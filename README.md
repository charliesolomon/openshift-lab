1. [ ] Set up a Platform as a Service (PaaS) environment on a single laptop, using a virtual network of connected virtual machines
2. [ ] Demonstrate a development/deployment workflow using the PaaS environment
3. [ ] Demonstrate an Operational Management feature which monitors resources in the PaaS environment and lists all applications/services deployed in containers
4. [ ] Use the experience gained from this lab to create a proposed architecture that can be used to build a PaaS environment in a corporate network
